# THM_notes
My notes and course reviews for the TryHackMe cybersecurity training platform.

## 📌 Purpose
TryHackMe provides structured, hands-on challenges across cybersecurity domains. I intend to document how I engage with each room and pathway, including reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and how each task fits into a broader security mindset.

## 📁 Structure
- Room summaries: High-level overviews and step-by-step notes.
- Learning path reviews: Commentary on each track’s value and flow.
- Key takeaways: Concepts that stuck, and why they matter.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy
I apply the same active recall method used across my other studies:
1. Read → Summarise each key idea in one line
2. Track → Append a second line summarising progress through the room/module
3. Repeat → Build a layered map of understanding over time
This pairing system helps me retain techniques and concepts without needing to re-do rooms before review.

## 🔍 Notes on Style
- I deliberately avoid copy-pasting solutions and stick to content.
- Repetition is by design — summarising in different words reinforces retention and reveals what I have or haven't grasped yet.

🧵 Why Do This Publicly?
- For myself: Cybersecurity requires pattern recognition and procedural memory. These logs make my patterns visible.
- For others: You’ll get a peek into how one learner makes sense of THM’s ecosystem, especially if you're new to Linux, networking, or cybersecurity.
